Title: The Last Ride of Rusty

In the quiet town of Elmsville, where the roads wound through golden fields and sleepy hills, there lived an old car named Rusty. He was a 1967 Ford Mustang, once the pride of the road — shiny red paint, roaring engine, and chrome wheels that caught the sun like diamonds.

1 But now, Rusty sat forgotten in a dusty garage behind Mr. Carter’s house. Mr. Carter, once a street racer in his youth, had grown old, and so had Rusty. Weeds crept under the garage door, and cobwebs clung to the mirrors. No one believed Rusty could move again — except for Sam.

2 Sam was Mr. Carter’s grandson, a shy 14-year-old with a wild imagination and a love for old cars. While his friends played video games, Sam spent hours sketching cars in his notebook. One summer morning, he peeked into the garage and met Rusty for the first time.
